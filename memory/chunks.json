A place-timed Petri net model is developed\nfor a railway network. Based on it, a con\ufb02ict avoidance method is\npresented to ensure that safety principles in railway networks are\nrespected. Also, a polynomial deadlock avoidance policy based on\nthe Banker\u2019s algorithm is proposed. It authorizes the movement\nof trains between block sections and stations. The proposed\ncon\ufb02ict avoidance method and deadlock avoidance policy together\nensure a railway network to be con\ufb02ict-free and deadlock-free.\nExperimental results show that they are effective and ef\ufb01cient.\n"

As the num-\nber of reachable markings of a PN grows exponentially with\nthe net size, there may be a huge number of unsafe markings\nfor a large scale deadlock-prone net. Once the rescheduling\nalgorithm [49] runs into these unsafe markings, it can hardly\njump out of them, causing its failure to \ufb01nd a schedule in\na reasonable time. Since deadlock avoidance or prevention\npolicies can avoid unsafe markings, the rescheduling algo-\nrithm [49] can be extended for large scale deadlock-prone nets\nby integrating with such policies.\nOnly a few studies focus on the logical control of railway\nnetworks [11]\u2013["

The \ufb01rst one is that each resource (block\nsection or station) cannot hold a number of trains which is\ngreater than its capacity. It means that the number of trains on\na resource (block section or station) cannot be greater than the\nresource\u2019s capacity. In other wo rds, the remaining capacity of\na resource should be greater than or equal to 0. More precisely,\n\u2200M \u2208 R(N, M\n0), \u2200r \u2208 B \u222a S, M(r) \u2265 0.\nThe second one is that there is a minimum headway\ntime (MHT) between two"
